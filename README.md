## V. Usage 📚
### Setting Up the Environment
1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/ml-toolkit.git
   cd ml-toolkit
   ```

2. **Create a Conda Environment**:
   If you haven't already installed Conda, download and install [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual) or [Miniconda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html). Then, create a new Conda environment for this project:
   ```bash
   conda create --name ml_toolkit_env python=3.8
   ```
   This command creates a new environment named ml_toolkit_env with Python 3.8, which is recommended for this project. Activate your new environment with:
   ```bash
   conda activate ml_toolkit_env
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies**:
   Inside the activated Conda environment, install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
   This command will install all necessary Python packages as specified in the requirements.txt file.
